                When the last great war has ended,<br>
                And the fires have cooled to grey,<br>
                What remains when all is mended?<br>
                Only stones along the way.<br>
                <br>
                Not for throwing, not for fighting,<br>
                But to build what we tore down.<br>
                Hands that once held weapons, writing<br>
                Hope upon the battleground.
