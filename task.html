   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <p>Solar power continues to gain importance as a sustainable and environmentally responsible energy solution due to the increasing global demand for clean power generation.<br> Although photovoltaic (PV) systems provide renewable electricity, their performance is strongly dependent on the angle at which sunlight strikes the PV panel. </p>
   <h2>Methedology</h2>
   <p>A dual-axis tracking system is implemented using an STM32 microcontroller. Four Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs) are positioned in a cross pattern to detect illumination from different directions.<br> Based on the sensed light intensity difference, the microcontroller generates appropriate PWM signals to drive two servo motors for azimuth and elevation adjustments.This continuous sensor-based positioning enhances panel exposure to incident sunlight, resulting in improved energy extraction </p>
